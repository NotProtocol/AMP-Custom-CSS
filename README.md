Red custom CSS for AMP,
CSS by me, Protocol.
AMP by [CubeCoders](https://cubecoders.com).

# How to use:

1: [Buy AMP, get the license key.](https://cubecoders.com/AMP) 

2: Make an AMP instance [here](https://cubecoders.com/AMPDownload).

3: Start your instance for the first time, then stop it.

4: Once you have stopped the instance, go into the WebRoot folder in your instance

5: After that, go into CSS.

6: You should see a Custom.css, if you don't, you haven't started the instance correctly

7: Place my Custom.css inside, and you should be ready!
