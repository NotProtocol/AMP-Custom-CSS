# AMP-Custom-CSS
Red custom css for AMP,
CSS By me.
AMP By CubeCoders.

# How to use:

1: Buy AMP, get the license key.

2: Make a AMP instance (https://cubecoders.com/AMPDownload)

3: Start your instance for the first time, then stop it

4: Once you have stopped the instance, go into the WebRoot folder in your instance

5: After that, go into CSS

6: You should see a Custom.css, if you don't, you haven't started the instance correctly

7: Place my Custom.css inside and you should be ready!
